Task_Tracker
============
I am writing this program for myself as a hobby project to learn some C++, QT4/5, and get familiar with github for version control. If I anyone uses this code I take no responsibility for any problems that may occur from using this software.

> Program Description:
===========================
This program is meant to aid in time management. The user selects a single task which can be clocked on and off. The instances at which the user clocked on and off are recorded and used to generate graphs to provide insight on how much time was spent or compare time spent between various tasks.

> Development Tools:
===========================
Compiler: minGW4.9.1 with -std=c++11
GUI Framework: Qt5.4
IDE: Qt Creator
